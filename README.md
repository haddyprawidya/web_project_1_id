# Learn how to learn
This is the second project of the Web Development program at Triple Ten. I Was created using HTML5 and CSS3, based on the design brief

## Project Features
* Semantic HTML5
* Positioning
* BEM File Structure
* Methodology BEM
* Embed Content
* CSS Animation

## Plan on improving the project
The future plan is to improve this project by adding full animations and being able to interact with the user through the chat box or comment field. Triple Ten will take me to be able to make it.
